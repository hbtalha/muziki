# muziki
A music player written in Flutter for personal use. (WIP)

Cloning the absolutely amazing [Musicolet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.krosbits.musicolet&hl=en_US&gl=US), in muziki I implemented the features I daily use in Musicolet and adding a feature, which is the main reason I am creating muziki, that lets the user search for song lyrics along with their timestamps from some api's and providing a sing along experience
